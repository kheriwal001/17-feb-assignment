    "Q.1> What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use \n",
    "     MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "Ans> MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible JSON-like format \n",
    "     called BSON. It is designed to handle large volumes of data, support high availability and horizontal \n",
    "     scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional \n",
    "     table-based relational database structure. Instead, they store data in different formats, such as \n",
    "     key-value pairs, documents, or graphs. This allows for more flexible data models, faster data processing, \n",
    "     and easier scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "     In scenarios where there is a need for high scalability, performance, and flexibility in data models, \n",
    "     MongoDB may be preferred over SQL databases. Some examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "      Big Data applications: MongoDB is designed to handle large volumes of data and perform well in distributed \n",
    "      environments, making it a good choice for Big Data applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "      Agile development: MongoDB's flexible schema allows for agile development, where data models can be easily\n",
    "      changed and updated as needed without the need for complex migrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "      Real-time applications: MongoDB's ability to handle high volumes of data and perform real-time processing \n",
    "      make it a popular choice for real-time applications, such as gaming or IoT applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "      Mobile applications: MongoDB's ability to synchronize data across multiple devices and platforms makes it \n",
    "      a good choice for mobile applications."

    "Q.2> State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "Ans> MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database that offers several features that make it a popular \n",
    "     choice for modern applications. Here are some of the key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "     Document-Oriented Data Model: MongoDB stores data as JSON-like documents, making it easy to work with \n",
    "     complex and unstructured data. This also makes it easier to map objects in your application to database \n",
    "     records.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Dynamic Schema: Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB does not require a predefined schema. \n",
    "     This makes it easy to add new fields to documents as needed, without affecting existing records.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers, making \n",
    "     it easy to handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "     High Availability: MongoDB supports automatic failover and replica sets, ensuring that your data is always \n",
    "     available even if a single server fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Indexing: MongoDB supports various types of indexes, including compound indexes, geospatial indexes, and \n",
    "     text indexes, which enable fast and efficient queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Aggregation: MongoDB supports powerful aggregation pipelines that allow you to perform complex data analysis \n",
    "     and transformation in the database itself, without the need for external tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "     ACID Transactions: MongoDB supports ACID transactions, which ensure data consistency and reliability, even \n",
    "     in complex multi-document operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Security: MongoDB includes built-in security features such as authentication, authorization, and encryption, \n",
    "     ensuring that your data is safe and secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Integration with Other Tools: MongoDB integrates with popular tools and frameworks such as Hadoop, Spark, and \n",
    "     Kafka, making it easy to use in a wide range of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Overall, MongoDB offers a flexible, scalable, and powerful platform for modern application development, with \n",
    "     a wide range of features to support complex data models and high-performance operations."

    "     If multiple documents match the query, only the first matching document will be deleted.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    delete_many(): This method is used to delete multiple documents that match a specific set of criteria. \n",
    "    It takes a query object as an argument, which specifies the criteria for the documents to be deleted. \n",
    "    All documents that match the query will be deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "    drop(): This method is used to delete an entire collection from a database. It does not take any arguments, \n",
    "    and simply deletes the entire collection."
